# AI2050 Community Perspectives
Community Perspectives are interview-led profiles meant to elevate AI2050 Fellows' research agendas for a science-curious general audience. Fellows are leading academics in diverse fields from computer science to art, conducting ambitious, often interdisciplinary work that is not easily funded by traditional funding sources. I am working with Schmidt Sciences to write Community Perspectives for the 2023 Senior and Early Career Fellows.
